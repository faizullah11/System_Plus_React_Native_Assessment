# System Plus React Native Assessment

A repository to test and evaluate React Native candidates for SE (Software Engineer) position.

## Introduction :

**This repository is designed and created to test React Native knowledge.
Remains the intellectual property of System Plus Pvt. Limited.**

## Brief:

**React is a Javascript library used to render UIs. React is an asynchronous library. It uses virtual DOM to optimise state updates. React is a hybrid library and supports both functional and class oriented programming.**

#### Class based React Programming:

Class based React Coding is Legacy React coding. Every component is defined as a class and each class has life cycle methods and constructors. It partially supports Object-orientation and inherits React component properties and methods.

#### Function based React Programming:

Function based React Coding is more optimised with latest versions of React and whole component is rendered as a function and life cycle is monitored through React Hooks and Context API.

## Instructions:

1. In this Assessment you are free to choose the type of React Programming. Although we recommend you use a mix of both Class and functional components.

2. You are not allowed to push code to this repository. Therefore you are
   required to create a copy of this repository on your own account and work on it.
   Hint: Make good use of git clone, git fork, git plugins for vs code etc.

3. This repository has a branch named Assessment. Clone/Fork this repository
   and checkout to Assessment branch.

4. In Assessment branch there will be a Readme.md file and it will have detailed tasks information.

5. You are supposed to submit a compilable and runnable code of the solution.

6. Solution in txt files will not be accepted.

7. For this Assessment we are supposing that you have a react-native environment setup on your machine.

8. You will be implementing a mobile app solution. Mobile app will be implemented using React Native and if you do not have React Native installed. Refer to this link for more information.
   https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

9. You will be given Design & Styling Tasks and Logical Tasks in React Native.

10. After you are done implementing a task, please add comments in the code file
    for clear understanding and add a Readme.md file if necessary.

11. Logical Problem solving is an open-ended programming exercise. Problem descriptions are
    provided and you are supposed to implement a solution. However, in design tasks you will have to strictly follow the styling & design provided.

12. In case of confusions, please contact at usama@systemplus.co
